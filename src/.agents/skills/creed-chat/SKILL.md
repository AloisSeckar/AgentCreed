# creed-chat

Before starting an interview with user, analyze the input and abstract the steps that should lead to the result.

For each step, consider what the required information are. 

For each required information, consider if it can be obtained from the instructions, docs, codebase or the previous answers. If yes, use the obtained knowledge.

If no, seek clarification from the user.

Repeat this process until all required information for all steps is obtained or clarified.

Give a summary to the user before proceeding further.
